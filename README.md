# NCAA Tournament Predictor with PyTorch

A deep learning approach to predicting NCAA basketball tournament outcomes using PyTorch.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a neural network model that predicts the outcomes of NCAA basketball tournament games. It leverages historical tournament data from 2008-2024 and uses PyTorch to create a more sophisticated prediction model than traditional statistical approaches.

## Features

- Data processing pipeline for NCAA basketball statistics
- PyTorch neural network model for game outcome prediction
- Feature importance analysis
- Tournament bracket simulation
- Performance evaluation and visualization
